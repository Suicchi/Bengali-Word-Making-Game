# Bengali-Word-Making-Game
This is the project I did for BSc. Made using Unity. 

I have modified and used dictionary file from the project openbangla-keyboard.

I have also used a converter for a part in converting bijoy texts to unicode equivalent and vice versa.

Photon Unity Networking has been used to implement multiplayer. UNET was being deprecated and the new UNET promised better networking features but I needed to have something solid.

To run the game, you need vc_redist.x64.exe from Microsoft on Windows.
